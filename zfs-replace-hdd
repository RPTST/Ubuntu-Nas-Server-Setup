We need to tell our pool to expand automatically once all the new disks have been added. We do this with the following

sudo zpool set autoexpand=on pool-Storage



After you have determined that a device can be replaced, use the zpool replace command to replace the device. If you are replacing the damaged device with different device, use syntax similar to the following:

sudo zpool replace StoragePool /dev/sda /dev/sdb

With a brand new disk and replacong old for new disks, you may need to run this instead:
sudo zpool replace Pool -f -o ashift=9 /dev/sdg /dev/sdh
